Working on a piece called 'Two Trees' which started when I walked towards what I thought was a tree on the horizon. Little did I know what was in store for me.  

Strangely enough, a few days after I posted those two sentences, I turned on the radio (2/7/23), and Don Paterson was just about to read his poem ['Two trees'](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=49796) (2007). I had never come across this poem before, and listened intently. I felt a curious connection between the poems. Paterson's seering poem takes a poetic axe to poetry itself. Perhaps this distant coincidental echo will help reassemble what is lost. Mine was inspired when walking on Ilkley Moor back in April, 2011.
