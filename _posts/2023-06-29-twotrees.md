I've been working on 'Two Trees' since 2011. It has come and gone, moved into poetry, stretched into song and soundscape, but never quite settled. In that time, a collection of tree-related pieces have coalesced, and become what I'm calling: Tree Series. In the interests of trying to get something manageable completed, I've been re-focusing on the Two Trees element recently. This video piece features photos from my original encounter which began on Ilkley Moor when I walked towards what I thought was a single tree on the horizon.

Strangely enough, a few days after I published the first two sentences of this post, I turned on the radio ([Poetry Please](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001nfzw) 2/7/23), and Don Paterson was just about to read his poem ['Two Trees'](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=49796) (2007). I had never come across this poem before, and listened intently. Beyond titles, I felt a curious connection between the poems. Paterson's searing work takes an axe to poetry itself. Perhaps this distant coincidental echo will somehow reconfigure a loss doubled.

An inadvertant work: Two poems. 

Today (28th September, 2023), I heard the news that the beautiful tree at 'Sycamore Gap' on Hadrian's Wall has been felled. Apparently a 16 year-old boy is the culprit. No reason worth considering. The location is now one of the most painful gaps in the North East. In mourning, I will listen to Elvis, 'Just Because'.
