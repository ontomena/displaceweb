This piece came as an idea when I was working with with frame guides on a video piece and observing a colour negative of a blue sky. Living between 'The Lakes' and the sea naturally brings most things into alignment with water. Not always blue. The 'blue screen of death' is a memory almost beloved, and it is strange to think that there are people around now who are familiar with computers who have never heard of it. The current global shambles regarding human displacement continues to demand attention.
