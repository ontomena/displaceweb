This piece is part of an ongoing project that is experimenting with ways of processing archive material. The words I am reading are from a text fragment written in 1999 that arose from a ritual walk I was devising between Leeds, Bradford and Halifax. The text is still on its journey after forming the basis of 'Mardship Bow', a novel published on Lulu Press Inc in 2009. The images are taken randomly from my archive, focusing mainly on 1999.

A pdf of the text is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n6cbadgRucVZLC6dmVOv5lolt4YrrLKj/view?usp=sharing)
