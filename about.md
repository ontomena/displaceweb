DisplacementActivities is a site according to Simon Bradley, combining archives with new material. I work with sound mainly, one way or another: oral history, installation, performance, locative media. If something doesn't sound, I often encourage it to do so.

This site was put together on Github using GitHub Desktop and Visual Studio Code. Although Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018, the free version still exists relatively unmolested. Many thanks to my son, Josh, for his help in the early stages.
