  # DisplacementActivities

...backwards is the way forward:  

“Never mind about the Russians. Mr. Gridley has become much more of a menace”---Franklyn Ambruster in *The Notorius Landlady*, 1962 

On October 27th, 1962, my father grabbed a few possessions, myself and my mother, piled us into the car and we set off for Cheddar Gorge, a journey of around 170 miles. 
 
The Cuban Missile Crisis occurred between 16th Oct 1962 – 29th Oct 1962, shortly after *The Notorious Landlady* was released.

 Everything is undergoing some form of displacement: we know this, but we often resist it. Perhaps the unending procession of human displacement through war and/or ecocide shades our understanding, or possibly our own mortal journey itself is something we might try to ignore but, like with that loose tile on the roof of the old homestead, rather than ignore it, DisplacementActivities, as a personal method, is not an avoidance of, but an attempt to engage with displacement in all its facets---starting with that tile! On some levels, Displacements may operate like unseen atoms and molecules colliding with other particles that are visible under a standard microscope, as in Brownian motion. The random walks of the larger particles may be explained by sub-microscopic nudging. If we pursue this into mystical realms searching for Deep Inner Peace and Stillness, we might become aware of a sudden temporary *absence* of DisplacementActivities---where nothing seems to be displacing anything whatsoever. We might notice the whirring of an air conditioning system falling silent, when we weren't actually aware of the sound it was making beforehand. In the sound world, this phenomenon is called 'remanence' (Jean-François Augoyard, 2005). Aside from the odd perceived lacuna, Displacements are pretty much a constant on every level. Thus, methods of DisplacementActivities emerge as a form of knowing or, more precisely, unknowing, as I have argued elsewhere.
 
 Pursuing this approach, my main modes of practice oscillate between sound, text and performance. These modes are often combined, glued together by images or symbols. Alongside this, walking is a constant and productive inspiration. Around 1999, I began to focus on location-based ambulant sound as a form of memory, and this began to shape a lot of my subsequent activity. Examples of this work are my series of [DisplacementActivities](https://displacementactivities1.wordpress.com/2018/02/14/thetraverse/), a form of trans-locational performance, and work more recent on [Sounds of Teotihuacan](https://teosoundmap.com/), a calmer form of GPS-based acoustic archaeology. The latest experiment along these lines, is literally along lines: *The Barrow Alignment*, which traces lines to and from Barrow Park in relation to the declination of magnetic north.

 [Martin Shaw](https://philipcarr-gomm.com/locating-true-north-hearts/) has referred to a 'True North in my heart' that appears to be a form of Deep Morality conjured from the depths of biological and geological time. Several exceptional artists discovered their True North early on in life, giving acute focus to their work from an early stage. Not quite so for me, although it should have been obvious that sound would be involved somehow, see [here](https://vimeo.com/786288031). I seem to have wobbled around Magnetic North for most of the time, but my navigational skills have improved a little since I worked out the difference between Magnetic and True North. To this end, experimental sound remains central, and a text such as this is probably drifting towards Grid North.  
 
A key aspect of sound is its ability to penetrate deeply while remaining fleeting. Periodic ritual walking echoes this quality by heightening our awareness of Deep Time as an infinitesimal process experienced constantly yet seldom noticed. Ultimately, an openness to small variations within a vast ongoing improvisation is all that is necessary. Listen, and ye shall find! 

Politics is most likely immanent in any art form, but particularly in one that engages with boundaries and edges, improvising freely with both human and non-human forms of obstruction. Tiny movements have the potential to be revolutionary---persistence of direction pervading through oscillation, akin to Henri Lefebvre's 'moments'. In a world where so many are compelled to move, any alignment with the [human flow](http://www.humanflow.com/action/) is almost certainly political: as with Ai Wei Wei's film, for instance. Otherwise, we end up in a 'Don't mention the war' situation, that has already been satyrised exquisitely by Cleese and Booth in *Fawlty Towers*. Times have moved on, or are we simply sliding backwards? What would backwards amount to? A hill of beans? Perhaps this diagram holds the key:
