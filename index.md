 ...sounding and walking with edges:

 My modes of practice have oscillated over the years between sound, text and performance. Generally, these modes have been combined in one way or another and glued together by visual elements. Alongside this, walking has been a constant inspiration, and more latterly a mode of productiuon, as I began to focus on audio-walks and trans-locational performance. One of the key aspects that I have found fascinating about sound is its ability to penetrate deeply while being so fleeting. Periodic ritual walking echoes this quality by heightening awareness of Deep Time as an infinitesimal process we experience constantly. Politics is immanent in any art that is drawn to boundaries or edges while improvising freely, engaging with both human and non-human forms of contestation. Any movement whatsoever has the potential to be revolutionary: persistence of direction pervades through oscillation. It strikes me that many artists discover the True North in their hearts (a Martin Shaw idea), early in life. I seem to have wobbled around my Magnetic North for most of the time, but my navigational skills have improved since I became aware of the difference. A text such as this is probably Grid North.
