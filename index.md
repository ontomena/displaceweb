  # DisplacementActivities
---

 ...sounding and walking with edges:

 Displacement Activities are pervasive, arguably more real than what we commonly understand as 'real'. It is difficult to imagine something that is not undergoing one form of displacement or another. Perhaps we can imagine an impermeable Monolith at the centre of the Universe, unmoving and unchanging, but that is beside the point.. In this sense, DisplacementActivities is not an avoidance but an engagement. Not one aspect of Being remains untouched. Even in the realm of Deepest Inner Peace and Stillness, I think you'd probably notice the sudden absence of DisplacementActivities—–in the same way you might notice the whirring of an air conditioning system suddenly stopping, when you weren't previously aware of it at all. This phenomenon is called 'remanence' by Jean-François Augoyard (2005). 
 
 Accordingly, my main modes of practice oscillate between sound, text and performance. These modes are often combined, glued together by images or symbols. Alongside this, walking is a constant inspiration and production. Around 1999, I began to focus on location-based ambulant sound as a form of memory. This shaped a lot of my subsequent activity. Examples of this kind of work are the series of [DisplacementActivities](https://displacementactivities1.wordpress.com/2018/02/14/thetraverse/), a form of trans-locational performance, and work on Adje Both's [Sounds of Teotihuacan](https://teosoundmap.com/), reconstructive acoustic archaeology. 
 
A key aspect of sound that I have found endlessly fascinating is its ability to penetrate so deeply yet remain fleeting. Periodic ritual walking echoes this quality by heightening our awareness of Deep Time as an infinitesimal process experienced constantly yet seldom noticed. 

Politics is immanent in any art that engages with boundaries and edges, improvising freely with both human and non-human forms of obstruction. In these circumstances, any tiny movement has the potential to be revolutionary: persistence of direction pervading through oscillation.  
 
 [Martin Shaw](https://philipcarr-gomm.com/locating-true-north-hearts/) has referred to a 'True North in my heart' that appears to be a form of Deep Morality conjured from the depths of biological and geological time. Several exceptional artists discovered their True North early on in life, giving acute focus to their work from an early stage. Not quite so for me, although it should have been obvious that sound would be involved somehow. I seem to have wobbled around Magnetic North for most of the time, but my navigational skills have improved since I became aware of the difference between Magnetic and True North. Experimental sound remains central, and so a text such as this is probably edging towards Grid North.
