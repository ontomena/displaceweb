...sounding and walking with edges:  

“All is flux. Nothing stays still,”---Heraclitus  

 Everything is undergoing some form of displacement: we know this, but we often resist it. DisplacementActivities, as a particular method I deploy, is not an avoidance of, but an engagement with an obscured reality touching all aspects of Being. This obscured reality is not necessarily mystical; perhaps it may be likened to the hidden atoms and molecules nudging particles visible under a standard microscope in Brownian motion. The random walks of the larger particles maybe be explained by sub-microscopic nudging. Even if we found ourselves in the realms of Deep Inner Peace and Stillness, we might become aware of a sudden temporary absence of DisplacementActivities---in the same way we might notice the whirring of an air conditioning system falling silent, when we weren't previously conscious of the sound at all. This phenomenon is called 'remanence' by Jean-François Augoyard (2005). In this liminal existence DisplacementActivities thrive, as an indirect form of knowledge.
 
 Accordingly, my main modes of practice oscillate between sound, text and performance. These modes are often combined, glued together by images or symbols. Alongside this, walking is a constant, productive inspiration. Around 1999, I began to focus on location-based ambulant sound as a form of memory. This has shaped a lot of my subsequent activity. Examples of this work are my series of [DisplacementActivities](https://displacementactivities1.wordpress.com/2018/02/14/thetraverse/), a form of trans-locational performance, and work on Adje Both's [Sounds of Teotihuacan](https://teosoundmap.com/), GPS-based acoustic archaeology. 
 
A key aspect of sound that I have found endlessly provocative is its ability to penetrate deeply while remaining so fleeting. Periodic ritual walking echoes this quality by heightening our awareness of Deep Time as an infinitesimal process experienced constantly yet seldom noticed. 

Politics is immanent in any art form that engages with boundaries and edges, improvising freely with both human and non-human forms of obstruction. Tiny movements have the potential to be revolutionary-- persistence of direction pervading through oscillation.  
 
 [Martin Shaw](https://philipcarr-gomm.com/locating-true-north-hearts/) has referred to a 'True North in my heart' that appears to be a form of Deep Morality conjured from the depths of biological and geological time. Several exceptional artists discovered their True North early on in life, giving acute focus to their work from an early stage. Not quite so for me, although it should have been obvious that sound would be involved somehow, see [here](https://vimeo.com/786288031). I seem to have wobbled around Magnetic North for most of the time, but my navigational skills have improved a little since I worked out the difference between Magnetic and True North. To this end, experimental sound remains central, and a text such as this is probably heading towards Grid North.
